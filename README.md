This is a crack at making a simple html file about recipes. 

I am currently learning from The Odin Project website about web development
and they have this wonderful lesson plan under the HTML lesson that teaches
online learners to make a simple recipe website using html.

I have learned the basics a few days ago and now it's time to put what I've
learned to the test. I think one of the best way for this to work is to 
document my journey into the world of coding and treat this as a diary where
I would jot down the finer trials and tribulations that I have encountered
during this fun-filled activity. It is perhaps better to summarize my work
as I move along with this particular project about recipes.
