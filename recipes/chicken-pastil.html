        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
        <p>
            Chicken Pastil is basically banana leaves wrapped steamed rice 
            topped with flavorful shredded chicken meat called "<em>kagikit</em>".
            A lot of people refer to the shredded meat as pastil but according 
            to some locals. If it's only the meat, you call it kagikit. It's 
            the perfect satisfying meal whether you eat it for breakfast, 
            lunch, or dinner. Making it at home is so easy too.
